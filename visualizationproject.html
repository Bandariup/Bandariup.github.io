    <h4>Visualization Project</h4>
    <p>
        For this project, I decide to work on Virginia Woolf’s A Room of One’s Own. As we know, Woolf was one of the feminists of the 20th century who tried to change how societies treated and dealt with females.</p>
<p>Since she was a feminist and her work, A Room of One’s Own, has been seen and interpreted as feminist, as critics have mentioned, it may not be surprising if we, the readers of her work, realize that she focused more on females than on males and used more words that had to do with females than that that had to do with males. So, what I tend to do first is that even though A Room of One’s Own is divided into six sections, parts, or chapters, I decide to upload the text, the six parts, as one text and see how Woolf deal with her gender terms. Here is what I got:</p>
