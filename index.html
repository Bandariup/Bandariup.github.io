    <h1>Brief Bio</h1>
<p>My name is Bandar Otayf, and I was born and raised in Jazan, Saudi Arabia (where I also lived, studied, and worked). I am married and a father of three kids (a daughter and two sons). In my free time, I like reading, traveling around the world, and playing video games with my kids. One more thing about myself is that I am fond of technology, and I like to learn various things about it.</p>
